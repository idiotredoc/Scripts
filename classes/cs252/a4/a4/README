Part A.
After hand-digesting the keys 1-34, I used digest.sh to run crypto to 
reveal plain.txt 

Part B.

I appended "cairo" to both plainfile1 and plainfile2, then used openssl to create the MAC for the two files. Once this was performed I compared the hashes to the MAC file you provided, and found that plainfile2 is indeed the original message.
